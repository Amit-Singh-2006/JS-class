📌 JavaScript Journey

This repository contains my learning journey of JavaScript, where I practice
core concepts, solve problems, and build small projects to improve my skills. I will be uploading 
daily progress including program files, notes, and experiments related to JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation,
functions, arrays, objects, async programming, and more. The goal of this repository is to stay consistent, track improvement, and grow 
from beginner to advanced level in JavaScript, ultimately preparing for real-world web development and future projects.
